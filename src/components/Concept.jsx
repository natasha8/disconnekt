                    The main concept topics behind our project are celebrating
                    the beauty of diversity between humans from different
                    cultures and backgrounds, gathering together and experience
                    this time in total freedom and enjoying arts under different
                    forms. End goal: Disconnect from the monotony of everyday
                    life!!!

                    During our events we offer to the crowd an experience,
                    filled with quality electronic music acts from all over the
                    world, playing different genres of music between different
                    floors, one always dedicated to Underground Techno and the
                    other alternating between House, Old School Disco, minimal
                    and many more. Not only do showcase headliners, but are
                    always looking for new up and coming acts, to provide them
                    with a platform to show their talent and grow.

                    In many cases, the quality of music would be enough, but we
                    feel that combining this with performance art, just adds
                    that special touch. These include visual shows,
                    contortionists, dancers, light installations, plant
                    installations and anything else that is stimulating to the
                    eyes.
