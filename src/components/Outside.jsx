                    In the last years, we had the opportunity to work with
                    different venues around the city, that hosted our event
                    series; expanding our contacts and facing all kinds of club
                    situations and realities. Thanks to this and the big passion
                    we put on our work, we had the opportunity between fail and
                    successes, to develop the maturity necessary to improve the
                    quality of our events.
