                    Disconnekt is a collective and label founded by Cristian,
                    Domingo & Fabrizio back in 2016 and has now grown to a crew
                    of over 20 passionate people. The project was started with
                    the aim to deliver quality techno music, in a safe and
                    friendly space, to help people disconnect from the monotony
                    of everyday life inside our city of Berlin. Our focus is to
                    support local djs, sound engineers, performers, graphic
                    designers, web developers, promoters, artist and anyone else
                    actively working to help setup and manage any of our events.
                </p>

                    Our collective has grown from the beginning without any
                    external financial aid and has purely been funded by our
                    founders and the continuous reinvesting into the business.

                    The Disconnekt events are open to all people, our collective
                    is a mix of straight, gay and open minded people that want
                    to break down the wall of judgement and unite everyone for
                    the love of good techno music.
