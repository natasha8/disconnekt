                    We always dreamed to give space to the talents we bring to
                    our events, by releasing their music under the name of our
                    project. Today we are honored to announce, the start of the
                    realization of this dream. Dedicated to everyone who has
                    been supporting us in the last years, the first vinyl of
                    Disconnekt Records is on his way. We are very thankful to
                    all the artists that agreed to collaborate with us and to
                    all our supporters who have made all of this possible.
