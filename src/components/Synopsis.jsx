                    Disconnekt is a dream masked as nightmare. A safe path of
                    the shape of an arduous and hostile trail. It is a blue sky
                    under dark clouds. It is the distant chant of malicious and
                    beautiful mermaids, a magical forest in a distant world.
                    Disconnekt is for all those who live good music as a mindset
                    and lifestyle. It is a whirlwind of such opposed still so
                    strongly attracted emotions and feelings.
