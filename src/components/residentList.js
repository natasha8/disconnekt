        text: "Dirty drums meets hypnotic patterns in fast paced rhythm which encapsulates true rave atmosphere and ecstatic freedom. Italian born, Flavia Laus began her musical journey in childhood by singing and experimenting with her voice, which gave her the first push to develop musical skills. Growing up, the strong connection with electronic music pushed her to discover the art of DJing and soon began playing at the local club scene where she developed her musical taste and skills behind the decks. After a period of performances, she felt the need to express herself in the studio studying electronic music production and experimenting with analog and digital synthesisers. Inspired by 90's old school tracks and constantly influenced by solid driving contemporary Techno, her sound is a perfect mix between acid lines, hypnotic melodies, swirling patterns and strong dirty grooves, a dynamic journey which moves the best of crowds on a regular basis.",

        His characteristic sound is hypnotic and energetic
        
        He released on his co-owned labet Disconnekt and on Death Bell records and on Casanova bar.
        
        Because he could not
        stop absorbing the light
        found within the darkness,
        the journey is written
        by us but the destination,
        and our story is endless.
        
        
        Sometimes you can find him playing more melodic funny housy old tunes during after hours.

        Since his earliest youth he has had a huge passion for electronic music, and through hanging out at the famous record store from the Capital “Remix”, he was introduced to the world of djing when he wa only 16 years old.
        He has got familiar to different forms of techno, his style ranging from a sound usually very hard and dark, often with industrial influences, to a very different one, deeper and more mental, both still easily recognizable as coming from the same mind.
        He started to perform very early as a dj in the clubs of the Capital and from 2007 he was resident dj at Goa Club for two seasons.`,
