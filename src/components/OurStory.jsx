                    Originating from the minds of three young artists who have
                    lived in Berlin since 2014, the concept came from a desire
                    to bring together a new community of people who share a
                    common love for underground culture and who are willing to
                    actively participate in the scene and support a new project
                    under a different artistic direction.

                    We started with our first rave, an illegal one under a
                    bridge and then we moved our operation to an industrial
                    basement in the center of Berlin. We started small, but our
                    events ran regularly and grew quickly, to the point where we
                    had to increase our crew.

                    In 2017 we moved our events to the nightclub IPSE (

                        do we say something about the closure due to fire
                    </span>
                    ) and in 2018 we hosted our events at the old Griessmuehle
                    venue.

                    In 2020 we moved our residency to the ://about blank and
                    then the pandemic started, which forced us to have to take a
                    break. However in 2021 we started back up again, this time
                    moving to Anomalie Art Club, this move came about due to the
                    pandemic situation and restricted capacity at ://about
                    blank.

                    The crew is working hard to continually upgrade the quality
                    of the events under all aspects and is now one of the
                    highlights of the Berlin Techno scene.
